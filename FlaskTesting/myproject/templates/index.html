        <div>As a 5'10'' person weighing 150 pounds, you are already within a healthy weight range. However, if you still wish to lose weight or tone up, incorporating a combination of cardiovascular exercises and strength training can help you achieve your goals.

Cardiovascular exercises like running, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking can help burn calories and aid in weight loss. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio.

Additionally, strength training exercises like weightlifting, bodyweight exercises, or resistance band workouts can help build muscle mass, increase your metabolism, and improve your overall body composition. Include strength training exercises targeting all major muscle groups at least 2-3 times per week.

It's important to remember that weight loss is also heavily dependent on your diet. Focus on eating a balanced diet rich in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Be mindful of portion sizes and avoid excessive intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat snacks.
